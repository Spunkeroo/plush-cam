<h1>Plush Collecting Guide: How to Start and Grow Your Collection</h1>
<div class="article-meta">Published February 23, 2026 &bull; By the <a href="https://plush.cam/">Plush.Cam</a> Community Team &bull; 17 min read</div>

<p>Plush collecting is one of the fastest-growing hobby categories in the world, and it is not hard to understand why. Stuffed animals are tactile, emotionally comforting, visually appealing, and available in an almost infinite range of characters, styles, sizes, and price points. What begins as a casual purchase &mdash; maybe a Squishmallow that caught your eye at Target, or a crane game win that felt too special to give away &mdash; can evolve into a deeply rewarding collecting hobby that connects you to a global community of passionate enthusiasts.</p>

<p>Whether you are sitting on three plush and wondering if you are a "collector" yet, or you are already running out of shelf space and need strategies for organizing a growing hoard, this guide covers everything you need to know about plush collecting in 2026. From finding your niche to hunting rare pieces, from display solutions to cleaning techniques, from budgeting wisely to joining communities that share your passion, consider this your comprehensive roadmap.</p>

<h2>Defining Your Collection: Finding Your Niche</h2>

<p>The first and most important decision for any plush collector is scope. The plush world is vast, and trying to collect everything is a fast track to a drained bank account and an overwhelmed living space. The most satisfying collections have a focus, a theme, a point of view that gives the collection coherence and makes each addition meaningful.</p>

<h3>Collection Niches to Consider</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Brand Focus:</strong> Collect exclusively from one brand. Squishmallows, Jellycat, Steiff, Build-A-Bear, and San-X are all popular single-brand collecting focuses. The advantage is clear boundaries and a defined universe of items to pursue.</li>
  <li><strong>Character Focus:</strong> Collect every plush version of a single character. Pikachu collectors, Hello Kitty collectors, and Winnie the Pooh collectors are among the most dedicated in the hobby. The variety within a single character across different manufacturers, sizes, and editions can be staggering.</li>
  <li><strong>Animal Type:</strong> Collect only cats, only bears, only frogs, only axolotls. This creates a visually cohesive collection that works beautifully as room decor and gives you a clear identity within the collecting community.</li>
  <li><strong>Era or Vintage:</strong> Collect plush from a specific decade. 1980s Care Bears, 1990s Beanie Babies, 2000s Webkinz, or pre-war Steiff bears are all viable vintage niches with active collector communities and well-established pricing.</li>
  <li><strong>Size Focus:</strong> Collect only mini plush (clip-ons and keychains), only standard sizes, or only giant/jumbo plush. Size-focused collections create visual drama and simplify storage and display.</li>
  <li><strong>Prize Plush:</strong> Collect exclusively from arcade crane games and claw machines. This includes Japanese UFO Catcher prizes, carnival plush, and wins from online claw machine platforms like <a href="https://claw.pizza">Claw.Pizza</a>. Each piece comes with a story of the win, which adds personal meaning beyond the plush itself.</li>
  <li><strong>Themed:</strong> Collect plush related to a theme like food (Jellycat Amuseables, Squishable food items), mythical creatures (dragons, unicorns, phoenixes), or ocean animals (whales, sharks, octopi).</li>
</ul>

<h3>It Is Okay to Not Have a Niche</h3>

<p>Some collectors prefer an eclectic approach, acquiring whatever speaks to them in the moment without constraints. This is completely valid. The "rule" about niches is more of a guideline that helps prevent decision fatigue and buyer's remorse. If your collection is a chaotic assemblage of things that all make you happy, that is a perfectly curated collection by the only metric that matters: your own joy.</p>

<h2>Where to Find Plush: A Collector's Sourcing Guide</h2>

<p>Knowing where to look is half the battle in plush collecting. Different sources offer different advantages, and the savvy collector uses all of them.</p>

<h3>Retail (New)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Target, Walmart, Five Below:</strong> The primary hunting grounds for Squishmallows and mainstream plush. New stock typically arrives on specific days (ask employees for the schedule at your local store). Five Below is particularly important for affordable Squishmallows and seasonal exclusives.</li>
  <li><strong>Official Brand Stores:</strong> Pokemon Center, Build-A-Bear, Jellycat stockists, and Sanrio stores carry their full current lines and often have store-exclusive items.</li>
  <li><strong>Hot Topic / BoxLunch:</strong> The best brick-and-mortar source for anime, gaming, and pop culture plush. BoxLunch exclusives are particularly collectible.</li>
  <li><strong>Amazon:</strong> Convenient but be cautious. Counterfeit plush is rampant on Amazon, especially for popular brands. Buy from verified brand storefronts or from Amazon itself (not third-party sellers) when possible.</li>
  <li><strong>Japanese Import Shops:</strong> AmiAmi, CDJapan, Plaza Japan, and Tokyo Otaku Mode for authentic Japanese plush that is not available through domestic retailers.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Secondhand and Resale</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Mercari:</strong> The most active marketplace for secondhand plush in the US. Prices range from excellent deals to absurd markups, so know the market value before buying.</li>
  <li><strong>eBay:</strong> Essential for vintage and rare pieces. eBay's authenticity guarantee covers some plush categories, and the auction format can yield bargains.</li>
  <li><strong>Facebook Marketplace and Groups:</strong> Local pickup eliminates shipping costs and lets you inspect plush in person. Plush-specific Facebook trading groups are also excellent for finding specific items.</li>
  <li><strong>Thrift Stores:</strong> Goodwill, Salvation Army, and local thrift shops are treasure troves for patient hunters. The vast majority of what you find will be common, but the occasional discovery of a rare vintage piece at $2 is what keeps thrift hunters coming back.</li>
  <li><strong>Estate Sales and Garage Sales:</strong> Often the best source for vintage collections being sold in bulk. If a longtime collector is downsizing, you can sometimes acquire impressive pieces at a fraction of their market value.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Claw Machines and Arcade Prizes</h3>
<p>Claw machines are not just a source of plush; they are an experience that adds story and emotional value to every piece. Physical arcades, particularly Japanese-style game centers, stock high-quality prize plush from brands like Banpresto, Taito, and Furyu. Online claw machine platforms like <a href="https://claw.pizza">Claw.Pizza</a> let you play real machines remotely from anywhere, with won plush shipped to your door. For collectors, claw machine wins carry a personal narrative that purchased plush simply cannot replicate. The story of how you won a specific piece becomes part of its identity in your collection.</p>

<h3>Conventions and Events</h3>
<p>Anime conventions (like Anime Expo, Otakon, and Comic-Con), toy conventions, and plush-specific meetups are excellent sourcing opportunities. Vendor halls often feature independent plush makers, imported Japanese plush, and vintage dealers. Some conventions have trading rooms where collectors can swap directly. The social element &mdash; meeting fellow collectors, seeing impressive collections, and discovering new brands &mdash; is as valuable as any purchase you make.</p>

<h2>The Art of the Hunt: Finding Rare and Valuable Plush</h2>

<p>For many collectors, the hunt is the most exciting part of the hobby. Finding a rare or sought-after piece at a reasonable price delivers a dopamine hit that few other shopping experiences can match.</p>

<h3>What Makes a Plush Rare</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Limited Production Runs:</strong> Plush produced in small quantities for specific events, store exclusives, or limited campaigns. Makeship campaign plush, convention exclusives, and short-run promotional items fall into this category.</li>
  <li><strong>Retired Designs:</strong> Brands that regularly retire designs (Jellycat, Squishmallows, Steiff) create scarcity organically. Once a design is retired, the only source is the secondary market.</li>
  <li><strong>Manufacturing Errors:</strong> Misprinted tags, unusual color variations, and factory errors can create one-of-a-kind pieces that are highly valued by serious collectors.</li>
  <li><strong>Regional Exclusives:</strong> Plush only available in specific countries or stores. Japanese Pokemon Center regional exclusives, theme park exclusives, and airline promotional plush are examples.</li>
  <li><strong>Vintage and Antique:</strong> Age itself creates rarity as pieces are lost, damaged, or discarded over decades. Pre-1950s Steiff bears, original Paddington Bear plush from the 1970s, and first-generation Beanie Babies in mint condition are among the most valuable plush toys in existence.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Hunting Strategies</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Set up alerts:</strong> Use eBay saved searches, Mercari keyword alerts, and Google Alerts for specific plush you are seeking. Being notified immediately when a piece is listed gives you first-mover advantage.</li>
  <li><strong>Know the release schedule:</strong> Follow official brand social media accounts and fan communities to know when new releases and limited editions are dropping. Being ready on release day is often the only way to get highly anticipated pieces at retail.</li>
  <li><strong>Build relationships:</strong> Get to know employees at stores you frequent. They can sometimes tell you when shipments are expected or set aside items they know you are looking for (though store policies vary on this).</li>
  <li><strong>Check regularly:</strong> Thrift stores, estate sales, and Facebook Marketplace are time-sensitive. Checking daily or even multiple times a day significantly increases your chances of finding gems before other hunters.</li>
  <li><strong>Be patient:</strong> The secondary market for most plush follows a predictable pattern: prices spike immediately after a piece sells out, peak within a few weeks, and then gradually decline over months as initial hype fades and more sellers list their inventory. Unless a piece is genuinely scarce, patience almost always results in a better price.</li>
  <li><strong>Trade, don't just buy:</strong> If you have duplicates or pieces you have outgrown, trading is often more cost-effective than selling and rebuying. Trading communities on Reddit, Discord, and Facebook facilitate direct swaps.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Displaying Your Collection</h2>

<p>A collection that is hidden away in boxes is not really being collected; it is being stored. Display is a crucial part of the collecting experience, both for your own enjoyment and for sharing your collection with visitors and online communities.</p>

<h3>Shelf Displays</h3>
<p>The most common display method and the most flexible. Floating shelves, cube storage systems (like IKEA Kallax), and traditional bookcases all work well for plush. Key considerations:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Avoid overcrowding. Each plush should have enough room to be seen and appreciated individually. When shelves are packed edge-to-edge, the visual impact of individual pieces is lost.</li>
  <li><strong>Grouping:</strong> Arrange by theme, color, size, or brand. Color-coordinated displays are particularly photogenic and popular on social media. Rainbow arrangements (ROY G BIV from left to right) are a collector classic.</li>
  <li><strong>Height variation:</strong> Use risers, small boxes, or stacked books behind plush to create depth and height variation. This prevents the "lineup" look and makes the display more dynamic.</li>
  <li><strong>Lighting:</strong> LED strip lights along shelf edges or small spotlights can dramatically improve display impact, especially in darker rooms. Warm white lights are most flattering for plush fabrics.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Wall-Mounted Displays</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Net hammocks:</strong> The classic solution for children's rooms, but also functional for adult collectors with limited floor space. Corner-mounted cargo nets hold dozens of small to medium plush.</li>
  <li><strong>Hanging baskets and planters:</strong> Repurposed hanging planters and macrame baskets create an attractive display that keeps plush off furniture surfaces.</li>
  <li><strong>Pegboard systems:</strong> Customizable pegboard walls with hooks and shelves allow you to rearrange your display easily. This is a popular option in collecting spaces and content creator studios.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Glass Cases and Acrylic Displays</h3>
<p>For valuable or delicate pieces, enclosed display cases protect against dust, sunlight, and accidental damage. IKEA's Detolf glass cabinet is the collector community standard for affordable enclosed display. For premium pieces (vintage Steiff, limited editions, signed items), museum-quality acrylic cases with UV protection are a worthwhile investment.</p>

<h3>Rotating Displays</h3>
<p>If your collection exceeds your display space (a common problem), implement a rotation system. Display a curated selection for a few weeks or a month, then swap in different pieces. Seasonal rotations (holiday plush in December, spring designs in April) keep your display fresh and give you an excuse to interact with your entire collection regularly.</p>

<h2>Caring for Your Collection</h2>

<p>Proper care preserves both the physical condition and the value of your plush collection. Different materials and ages require different approaches, but these principles apply broadly.</p>

<h3>Regular Cleaning</h3>

<div class="highlight-box">
<h3>Machine Washing (When Safe)</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Check the care label first. If it says machine washable, proceed. If it says surface wash only, do not machine wash.</li>
  <li>Place the plush in a mesh laundry bag or pillowcase tied shut. This protects it from agitation and prevents small parts from snagging.</li>
  <li>Use cold water and a gentle, fragrance-free detergent. Hot water can damage fabrics and cause colors to bleed.</li>
  <li>Select the delicate or gentle cycle with a low spin speed.</li>
  <li>Air dry completely. Lay flat on a clean towel or hang from a clothesline. Never use a machine dryer unless the care label explicitly permits it. Heat can melt synthetic fibers, shrink natural fibers, and damage adhesives.</li>
  <li>Once dry, fluff the fur by gently brushing with a clean, soft-bristled brush or pet slicker brush.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h3>Hand Washing</h3>
<p>For plush that is not machine-safe, hand washing is the safest wet-cleaning method. Fill a basin with cold water and a small amount of gentle detergent. Submerge the plush and gently squeeze (do not twist or wring) to work the soapy water through the fabric. Rinse thoroughly with clean cold water until all soap is removed. Squeeze out excess water gently, then roll in a clean towel to absorb moisture. Air dry completely.</p>

<h3>Surface Cleaning</h3>
<p>For vintage, valuable, or extremely delicate plush, surface cleaning is the safest option. Use a damp cloth with a tiny amount of gentle detergent and gently wipe the surface. Follow with a clean damp cloth to remove soap residue. Allow to air dry. This method does not clean the interior filling but is sufficient for removing surface dust and light stains.</p>

<h3>Deodorizing</h3>
<p>For plush that smells musty or stale (common with thrift store finds and vintage pieces), sprinkle baking soda liberally over the surface, let it sit for at least 30 minutes (overnight is better), and then vacuum it off with an upholstery attachment. Repeat if necessary. For persistent odors, placing the plush in a sealed bag with activated charcoal for several days can be remarkably effective.</p>

<h3>Stain Removal</h3>
<p>Address stains immediately when possible. Blot (never rub) with a clean cloth dampened with cold water. For stubborn stains, a paste of baking soda and water applied to the stain, left for 15 minutes, and then wiped away often works. For ink or dye stains, isopropyl alcohol on a cotton swab can be effective, but test on an inconspicuous area first to ensure it does not damage the fabric or cause colors to bleed.</p>

<h3>Storage</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Never vacuum seal</strong> plush for long-term storage. The compression damages filling permanently, and the plush may never regain its original shape.</li>
  <li><strong>Use breathable containers:</strong> Cotton storage bags, open bins, or cardboard boxes with ventilation holes are all appropriate. Avoid plastic bins with sealed lids, as trapped moisture can cause mold and mildew.</li>
  <li><strong>Include desiccants:</strong> Silica gel packets in storage containers absorb excess moisture and prevent musty odors.</li>
  <li><strong>Store in a climate-controlled space:</strong> Avoid attics (too hot), basements (too damp), and garages (temperature fluctuations). A closet in a climate-controlled room is ideal.</li>
  <li><strong>Protect from pests:</strong> Cedar chips or lavender sachets deter moths and other fabric pests. Check stored plush periodically for signs of pest damage.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Budgeting and Financial Considerations</h2>

<p>Like any collecting hobby, plush collecting can become expensive if not managed thoughtfully. Here are strategies for keeping the hobby sustainable and enjoyable rather than stressful.</p>

<h3>Set a Monthly Budget</h3>
<p>Decide on a monthly plush budget and stick to it. This can be any amount that is comfortable for you &mdash; $20, $50, $100, or more. The specific number matters less than the discipline of having a number. When you see something you want but you have already hit your budget, add it to a wish list and revisit it next month. If you still want it, it becomes a priority for the next budget cycle. This waiting period also prevents impulse buys that you might regret.</p>

<h3>Track Your Spending</h3>
<p>Keep a simple spreadsheet or use a tracking app to log every plush purchase, including the item, date, price, and source. This serves multiple purposes: it helps you stay within budget, it provides data for insurance purposes (in case of theft or damage), and it gives you a clear picture of your collecting patterns over time.</p>

<h3>Know When to Pass</h3>
<p>Not every piece is worth acquiring, even if it fits your collection focus. Secondary market prices for hyped plush are often inflated in the short term and come down over time. FOMO (fear of missing out) is the most expensive emotion in collecting. Unless a piece is genuinely rare and you have strong evidence that the price will only increase, patience is usually the financially smarter choice.</p>

<h3>Consider Resale Value</h3>
<p>If financial sustainability is important to your collecting approach, focus on pieces with strong resale potential: limited editions, retired designs from popular brands, convention exclusives, and pieces in mint condition with tags attached. This does not mean treating plush as a financial investment (it is a hobby, not a portfolio), but being aware of resale value means you can adjust your collection without major financial losses if your interests change.</p>

<h2>Joining the Community</h2>

<p>Plush collecting is infinitely more enjoyable as a shared experience. The plush community in 2026 is active, welcoming, and spread across multiple platforms.</p>

<h3>Online Communities</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Reddit:</strong> r/Squishmallows (over 200K members), r/plushies, r/Jellycat, and r/BuildABear are active communities for discussion, trading, and sharing collections. The culture tends toward supportive and enthusiastic.</li>
  <li><strong>Discord:</strong> Many plush brands and fan communities have Discord servers for real-time chat, trading, and release notifications. Search for servers dedicated to your specific collecting niche.</li>
  <li><strong>Instagram and TikTok:</strong> The visual nature of plush collecting makes it perfect for image and video platforms. Hashtags like #plushcollector, #squishmallows, #plushcommunity, and #stuffedanimalcollection connect you to thousands of fellow collectors. Plush "shelfie" posts and collection tours are hugely popular content formats.</li>
  <li><strong>Facebook Groups:</strong> Trading-focused groups on Facebook remain one of the best places for buying, selling, and swapping plush. Groups tend to be organized by brand, region, or collecting focus.</li>
  <li><strong>YouTube and Twitch:</strong> Plush unboxing videos, collection tours, haul videos, and live claw machine streams are popular content categories. Watching others engage with the hobby is both entertaining and educational. Platforms like <a href="https://plush.cam/">Plush.Cam</a> aggregate live plush content and claw machine streams for easy browsing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>In-Person Events</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Plush Meetups:</strong> Organized through Facebook, Meetup.com, and Discord, these are local gatherings where collectors bring their favorites, trade, and socialize. If one does not exist in your area, starting one is as simple as posting in a local collecting group.</li>
  <li><strong>Conventions:</strong> Anime conventions, toy fairs, and comic cons all have significant plush presence. Some events, like the annual Steiff collectors' convention in Germany, are specifically dedicated to plush.</li>
  <li><strong>Build-A-Bear Events:</strong> Build-A-Bear Workshop hosts special events, release parties, and "Pay Your Age" days that draw collectors in large numbers.</li>
  <li><strong>Arcade and Claw Machine Events:</strong> Some game centers host claw machine tournaments and special prize events. Online platforms like <a href="https://claw.pizza">Claw.Pizza</a> sometimes run community events with special prizes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Documenting and Sharing Your Collection</h2>

<p>Documenting your collection serves both practical and social purposes. On the practical side, a thorough inventory helps with insurance claims, tracking value, and knowing exactly what you own. On the social side, sharing your collection connects you with the community and can inspire others.</p>

<h3>Photography Tips for Plush</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Natural light is king:</strong> Photograph plush near a window with diffused natural light. Direct sunlight creates harsh shadows, but indirect light makes fabrics glow.</li>
  <li><strong>Clean backgrounds:</strong> A clean, uncluttered background makes the plush the star. A solid-colored blanket or a simple shelf backdrop works well.</li>
  <li><strong>Eye level:</strong> Photograph plush at their eye level rather than looking down at them. This creates a more engaging, personality-filled image.</li>
  <li><strong>Group shots:</strong> Arrange collections in visually pleasing compositions. Color gradients, size progressions, and themed groupings all make for compelling photos.</li>
  <li><strong>Detail shots:</strong> Close-ups of tags, embroidery details, and fabric textures are valuable for documentation and appeal to fellow collectors who appreciate craftsmanship.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Inventory Management</h3>
<p>For collections above 50 pieces, a formal inventory system becomes valuable. Options range from a simple spreadsheet (Google Sheets works well) to dedicated collecting apps. Your inventory should include, at minimum: item name, brand, date acquired, price paid, condition, and a photo. For valuable pieces, add the purchase source and any authentication details.</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes New Collectors Make</h2>

<p>Every experienced collector has learned these lessons the hard way. Save yourself the trouble.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Buying everything at first:</strong> The initial excitement of discovering plush collecting can lead to buying anything and everything. This results in a cluttered, unfocused collection and buyer's remorse. Start slowly, define your focus, and be selective.</li>
  <li><strong>Paying scalper prices:</strong> Secondary market prices immediately after sellout are almost always inflated. Unless a piece is confirmed as extremely limited production, waiting 2-3 months typically yields a better price.</li>
  <li><strong>Ignoring condition:</strong> Tags, stains, odors, and damage all affect value significantly. When buying secondhand, always ask for detailed photos and honest condition descriptions. "Good condition" means different things to different people.</li>
  <li><strong>Neglecting display:</strong> Stuffing plush into bins or piling them in corners diminishes both your enjoyment and their condition. Invest in display solutions early.</li>
  <li><strong>Collecting for investment:</strong> While some plush appreciates in value, treating the hobby primarily as a financial investment usually leads to disappointment. Collect what you love, and any future value appreciation is a bonus.</li>
  <li><strong>Comparing your collection to others:</strong> Social media can make it seem like everyone else has a bigger, better, more complete collection. Remember that you are seeing curated highlights, not the full picture. A collection of 10 pieces you adore is more valuable than 200 pieces you feel lukewarm about.</li>
</ol>

<h2>The Future of Plush Collecting</h2>

<p>Plush collecting in 2026 is more mainstream, more connected, and more diverse than it has ever been. Several trends are shaping where the hobby goes next.</p>

<p>Digital integration is creating new dimensions for collecting. NFC tags in plush that link to digital certificates of authenticity, augmented reality experiences triggered by physical plush, and blockchain-verified limited editions are all emerging concepts that will mature in the coming years. These technologies add value for collectors who care about provenance and authenticity without changing the fundamental physical appeal of the plush itself.</p>

<p>Sustainability is becoming a collecting value, not just a manufacturing consideration. Collectors are increasingly interested in the environmental credentials of the brands they support, and secondhand and vintage collecting aligns naturally with sustainability values. The "pre-loved plush" market is growing rapidly as a result.</p>

<p>Community platforms continue to evolve. Live streaming platforms where collectors share their shelves, unbox new arrivals, and play claw machines together in real time are building stronger connections between collectors globally. Watching someone play a claw machine on <a href="https://claw.pizza">Claw.Pizza</a> and cheering them on creates a shared experience that was impossible a few years ago.</p>

<p>And the most important trend of all: normalization. Adult plush collecting is no longer a niche or an eccentricity. It is a recognized, respected hobby with its own culture, community, and economy. The stigma that once surrounded adults with stuffed animals has largely disappeared, replaced by an understanding that comfort, aesthetic pleasure, and the joy of collecting are universal human needs that plush fulfills beautifully.</p>

<h2>Getting Started: Your First Steps</h2>

<div class="highlight-box">
<h3>Your Plush Collecting Starter Checklist</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Acquire 1-3 plush that genuinely make you happy. Do not overthink this first step.</li>
  <li>Identify what draws you to those pieces. Is it the brand? The character? The fabric? The aesthetic? This will inform your collecting focus.</li>
  <li>Set a monthly budget that feels comfortable and sustainable.</li>
  <li>Join one online community (Reddit, Discord, or Facebook) related to your interest area.</li>
  <li>Set up a simple display space, even if it is just one shelf.</li>
  <li>Start a basic inventory (a spreadsheet or even a notes app will work initially).</li>
  <li>Follow 5-10 fellow collectors on social media for inspiration and community.</li>
  <li>Visit a local retail store (Target, Five Below, Hot Topic) and browse the plush aisle with fresh eyes.</li>
  <li>Try winning a plush from a claw machine (online via <a href="https://claw.pizza">Claw.Pizza</a> or at a local arcade) for the experience.</li>
  <li>Most importantly: enjoy the process. Collecting is a journey, not a destination.</li>
